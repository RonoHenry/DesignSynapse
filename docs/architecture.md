# DesignSynapse Architecture

## Overview

DesignSynapse is a comprehensive AI-driven platform for the DAEC (Design, Architecture, Engineering, Construction) industry that aims to automate and integrate fragmented tasks within the built environment. The platform serves as a unified ecosystem where clients can access all construction-related services through an AI-orchestrated system.

## System Architecture

### 1. Frontend Layer
- **Client Application** (`/client`)
  - React/TypeScript-based SPA
  - BIM Viewer integration
  - Interactive design workspace
  - Project management interface
  - Real-time collaboration tools

### 2. Backend Services
- **Main Server** (`/server`)
  - FastAPI-based REST API
  - Authentication and authorization
  - Project management
  - File handling and storage
  - Analytics processing

- **AI Services** (`/ai`)
  - Design generation models
  - Rendering automation
  - Engineering calculations
  - Cost estimation
  - Divided into specialized modules:
    - Client Sync
    - Draft Generation
    - Quote Master
    - Site Master
    - Stage Master

### 3. Data Layer
- **Data Warehouse**
  - Star schema for analytics
  - Project metrics
  - User activity tracking
  - Performance monitoring

- **ETL Pipeline**
  - Airflow-based data processing
  - Scheduled analytics
  - Data synchronization
  - Metric calculation

### 4. Integration Layer
- **External Tool Integration**
  - BIM software connectors (Revit, ArchiCAD)
  - Rendering engine integration
  - Engineering software integration
  - Document management systems

### 5. AI Orchestration
- **Language Model Interface**
  - Natural language processing
  - Task coordination
  - Tool selection and execution
  - Workflow automation

## Data Flow

1. Client requests enter through the frontend interface
2. Requests are processed by the backend API
3. AI orchestrator determines required tools and workflows
4. Tasks are distributed to specialized AI services
5. Results are aggregated and returned to the client
6. Analytics data is captured and processed in the data warehouse

## Security Architecture

- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- Secure file storage
- API rate limiting
- Audit logging

## Deployment Architecture

- Containerized microservices (Docker)
- Cloud-native deployment
- Scalable infrastructure
- High availability setup

## Development Workflow

1. Local development environment
2. CI/CD pipeline
3. Staging environment
4. Production deployment
